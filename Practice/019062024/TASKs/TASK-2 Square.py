# â€¢ Develop a Python script that calculates the
# square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8

num = 2   #Given num

square = num ** 2    # Calculate the square

cube = num ** 3      # Calculate the Cue

# Print the results
print(f"The square of {num} is {square}")
print(f"The cube of {num} is {cube}")
